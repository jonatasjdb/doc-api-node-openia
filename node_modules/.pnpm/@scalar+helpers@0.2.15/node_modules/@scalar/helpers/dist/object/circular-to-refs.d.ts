/**
 * Detects and breaks circular JavaScript object references in an OpenAPI document tree.
 *
 * The legacy API client (via openapi-parser's dereference) resolved all $refs inline:
 * it deleted the $ref key and copied every property from the resolved target directly
 * onto the object. For self-referencing or mutually-referencing schemas this created
 * circular JS object graphs that cannot be serialized to JSON or validated by TypeBox.
 *
 * This function walks the object tree depth-first, detects cycles via reference identity,
 * extracts each circular component into the appropriate components section (schemas,
 * responses, parameters, etc.) with a generated name, and replaces ALL occurrences
 * (both first and back-references) with **only** `$ref` and any extra properties
 * (no extra schema properties) so that TypeBox's Value.Cast picks the reference branch
 * of the schemaOrReference union.
 *
 * Returns a new (deep-cloned) document with all cycles replaced. When no circular
 * references exist, the output is structurally identical to the input.
 *
 * @param document - The OpenAPI document to process
 * @param extraProps - Extra properties to add as siblings to the $ref (e.g., '$ref-value')
 * @returns A new document with circular references replaced by $ref pointers
